I used to have an [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) blog here which was very infrequently updated.
Since I'm currently in the process of making some reasonably big changes in my
life, I decided it would be a good time to start writing about things again.
However, when I opened my text editor to create a new post, I was once again
confronted with the arduous task of figuring out how the hell Octopress worked
... again! I even wrote myself a blog post in the past explaining it, so that
I could teach future me how to use it.

Stupid.

So, I've trashed the whole thing and am starting afresh with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). So far it seems very straightforward to use.
Perhaps this time I'll maintain my writing focus!?

We'll see :)
